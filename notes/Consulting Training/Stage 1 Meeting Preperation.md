# Initial Client Meeting

Steps for a successful first meeting.

1.  What is our objective/aim in the initial meeting?
2. Imagine you have completed a meeting and imagine that you are doing whatever you need to be doing immediately after that meeting. From the position immediately after the meeting ask yourself what should you have asked to be as most successful with questions and establishment to the meeting for it to have been successful to the meeting.

#### After the meeting
Come to a complete mental picture to what just happened with whomever you went to the meeting with (i.e. partner who joins you). What did we learn in the meeting? What did we not learn in the meeting? What did we ask in the meeting? What did we not ask in the meeting? What did we get asked to do in the meeting? What did we not get asked in the meeting? 

Think about the next steps and create a document. (statement of work/plan)

##### What's in the document?
1. What the expectations are?
2. What other information will we need to help them?
3. Who do we get the information from?
4. Who is our main stake holders that will be apart of this project?
5. Our roles?
6. Their roles?
7. What the objectives are?
8. Timeline.
9. Resources
10. What the main deliverance's are?
11. What is LD's role in this?

## Meeting planning
Write down the 6-8 key critical questions you need to ask in the meeting. Always feel free to ask additional questions & probing questions or clarification questions.

*One question always recommended to ask is:*
What do yous see as the main objectives of the project? What would success look like... i.e. following a successful completion, what things would be happening that aren't currently happening? In what way? What will you be looking at following this initiative to gauge how successful we have been?

#### Questions we may get asked and how to answer.
1. How much?
2. How long?
3. How will you fix it?

- Mention the process.
- Answer the question with a question. i.e. Ask for a budget or timeline.
- Mention you will get back to them with an answer. You can't use this too much. This can be reused if you also add that you may have to re-mention the process.
- Give an indicative answer - "In our experience... could take 3-6 months but could be a lot longer depending on the complexity" -> Manage **EXPECTATIONS**
- Pre-empt the questions. Ask the question before they ask the question.
