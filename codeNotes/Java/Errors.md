# Errors

"Java errors are nothing to be afraid of..."

Java errors are very clear and coherant

```java
/Users/jaredg/Desktop/Projects/Java_Tutorials/src/me/jaredg/Main.java:8:28 // line and char location of error
  
java: cannot find symbol 					// what is the error
  symbol:   variable a231					// what symbol are we talking about
  location: class me.jaredg.Main 	// what class is this error located
```
